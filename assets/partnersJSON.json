It\u2019s located in the middle of the Old Town and has the distinct advantage of being close to... well, just about everything, so you won\u2019t have to worry about arranging local transport when you wake up groggy from a night out on the town.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe hostel (constructed in an old house) has two dorms and two private rooms, all at prices which are quite reasonable by local standards. Although the place is only open in summertime, you\u2019ll find that it\u2019s rarely packed to the gills like some of the wilder hostels in town. Come expecting to relax, not necessarily to continue the party after you get home. To that end, there are great balconies throughout the building and strong showers with nice hot water to rinse off the traveling grime. Sit back afterwards in one of the comfortable leather couches in the common room, or check out the quirky decorations. Laundry service is available, wi-fi is free, and you\u2019ll love the common kitchen if you\u2019re the type who likes to save money by hitting up the grocery stores. Take cash when you check in, though, as credit cards are not accepted.",

Eggs are considered the most perfect package on earth- flawless and seamless, they symbolize the universe itself and the rebirth of the fruitful world after the long winter.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nPainted eggs take on added significance due to the patterns or images they are given by the artisan. Head to Simyac\u0131 while you\u2019re in \u015eirince and take a look at the vast array of different painted egg designs, all done by hand. They\u2019ll give you a guide to the symbolism so you can work out what each one means for yourself!",

With roughly 50,000 permanent residents, Ku\u015fadas\u0131 spends the winters in relative silence, growing significantly in the high summer season with the influx of tourists. The modern town center and harbor area is lined with shops and small cafes, where you can find good deals on carpets and other souvenirs with some patience and a little skill at the age-old art of haggling.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAccommodation options are numerous here, but one of the most highly-recommended is without a doubt Sezgin Hotel, which offers single, double, or triple rooms. The owner is a former traveler himself, and has gone out of his way to furnish the place with everything you might need for your life on the road. There\u2019s an Internet cafe if you don\u2019t have your own laptop along (and wi-fi for those of you who do); log on here for a bit and smoke a water pipe, locally known as nargile.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThere\u2019s an outdoor swimming pool and a book exchange as well, the latter featuring a number of guidebooks to the region so you\u2019ll have no trouble planning out the next leg of your journey. If it\u2019s recommendations you\u2019re after, though, another awesome resource is the staff themselves, who have done their share of traveling around Turkey and have tons of ideas ready to offer you in English, German, Korean, or Japanese. Also check out the restaurant and barbecue in their beautiful garden! Breakfast is a buffet, included in the price, so you\u2019re sure to start each day with a full stomach.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nGetting to Ku\u015fadas\u0131 is usually a pretty straightforward affair; catch a bus from most cities in Turkey. A stay in Ku\u015fadas\u0131 is also a great opportunity to take a brief sojourn in Greek territory, as there are daily ferry services to the Greek island of Samos.",
